# Substratum Documentation

In this repo, there will information regarding Substratum, OMS7, and our theme
template. This is meant to be a jumping off point for ROMs and themers wanting
to get on board with our platform. If there is something you feel needs to be
added, either contact Nathan Chancellor using the info below or open an issue/pull
request in this repo.

A lot of our development happens in Slack; if you think you should have access, please
reach out to either Nathan Chancellor or Nicholas Chum using the information below to
discuss it with them. This is open to contributors, ROM developers and themers.

Themers, please view [this](https://github.com/substratum/database#substratum-database)
for info on submitting your theme for the showcase.

ROM developers, please read the top of the supported ROMs page for info on adding
your ROM to that list.
